# Obol production-readiness matrix

Last reviewed: 2026-08-23

This is the release qualification plan for the BRL-CAD Obol drawing stack.  A
row is green only when it was run against the final binaries and records its
model, renderer, cache state, event script, viewport/DPR, report, images, and
performance evidence.  Historical measurements belong in
`libbobol_engineering_lessons.md`, not here.

## Current evidence snapshot

| Area | Current evidence | Release status |
|---|---|---|
| focused CTest gate | `drawing_baseline` + `bobol_headless`: 86/86 passed in 408 s; one unavailable X11 capability skipped | repeat after production changes |
| control-plane models | `obol_lod_control`, `ObolHostWork`, and `ObolLodConvergence` pass TLC; the latter explored 562 states / 355 distinct with two input epochs | focused gate green |
| Lucy OSMesa | smooth zoom refined during input, returned to roughly 559k faces, and compacted resident data from about 22.0 to 6.15 MiB when zoomed out | focused regression green |
| 50k OSMesa | certified-warm shaded lifecycle passed in 60.6 s with exact coverage, no boxes, and no pending work | wire and cold rows need current evidence |
| 150k OSMesa | certified-warm shaded/wire lifecycles passed in 56.8/86.8 s with exact coverage, no boxes, no stagnant dispatches, and explicit software-performance limits | cold rows and visual-significance qualification remain |
| System GL | prior evidence exists, but this host has no usable X socket for an exact-current rerun | not current-binary qualified |

The 150k terminal view may validly be performance-limited.  It is not visually
qualified until prominent-object quality floors are demonstrated on realistic
large models, not merely synthetic coverage fixtures.

## Common acceptance criteria

Every graphical row must show:

- correct final camera, extent, draw mode, colors/materials, lighting, and
  retained scene composition;
- exact visible occurrence classification, no unexpected boxes, no empty
  frame, no invalid geometry, and coherent shaded/wire cut semantics;
- no owner-thread pending-without-witness loop, stale result, coordinator
  invariant violation, or unbounded worker/resident allocation;
- semantic selection, tree state, highlights, erase/redraw, and edit
  promotion consistent with command and widget state;
- stable-frame, first-useful-image, interaction-latency, resident/peak-memory,
  cache, and representation telemetry within the row's declared threshold;
- visually inspected checkpoint images.  APNG is required for suspected
  flicker; apitrace is required for System-GL-only corruption or state leaks.

The GUI runner may allow cold asset construction time, but a timeout, crash,
sanitizer finding, empty capture, unexplained terminal box, pending idle loop,
or a missing report fails the row.

## Required models

| Model | Primary purpose |
|---|---|
| Generic Twin | production visual baseline; tail/hull/engine, autoview, lighting |
| Lucy | spatial-page demand, close zoom, smooth refinement, compaction |
| multi-Lucy/xpush | shared-asset reuse and visibility turnover |
| Hubble | deep hierarchy, selection/tree scale, small-component importance |
| Havoc | mixed hierarchy and real-model interaction |
| NIST BREP corpus | wire/shaded BREP and adaptive tessellation behavior |
| Stanford meshes | varied manifold/non-manifold mesh behavior |
| 5k/50k/150k varied fixtures | distinct assets, mixed sizes/colors/regions/hierarchy, aggregate budgets |
| independent multi-gigabyte vehicle | real visual significance, I/O, memory, and unique-mesh behavior |

Synthetic fixtures must include mostly manifold inputs, mixed mesh sizes,
visually prominent components, color/region variation, and deep hierarchy.
Repeated-instance and distinct-asset cases are separate obligations.

## Matrix

### Lower-level/shared stack

- Clean Ninja build of qged, MGED, gsh, Archer/TkObol, rtwizard, and plugins.
- `bobol_contract`, `bobol_headless`, `drawing_baseline`, libbg polygon,
  librt discovery/edit, libbu cache, installed-package consumer, public-header,
  and symbol-manifest tests.
- TLC configurations for occurrence publication, host work, and bounded
  Lucy/large-scene convergence.
- Shared-stack ASan/UBSan: workers active during teardown, cache corruption,
  endpoint replacement, plugin reload, edit cancellation, and rapid close.
- Native-worker TSan/LSan; do not count a container runtime limitation as a
  successful dynamic analysis run.

### qged controls and interaction

Run each applicable row in single and quad layouts, DPR 1 and fractional DPR,
before/after resize, on System GL and OSMesa.

- Camera: MGED orbit, rotate, translate, center, zoom, smooth round trip,
  autoview, aspect changes, navigation gizmo, and camera/history readback.
- Selection: point and rectangle, append/toggle/subtract, tree-to-scene and
  scene-to-tree propagation, selection under erase/redraw, and Hubble latency.
- Faceplate: axes/ticks, grid, ADC, HUD progress, lighting profiles,
  framebuffer modes, raytrace overlay/underlay/interlay, snapping, and view
  settings.
- Polygon/measurement: direct mouse creation and editing, booleans, snapping,
  persistence, cancellation, command readback, all measurement modes, labels,
  units, and resize.
- Primitive/sketch editing: actual widgets and mouse gestures, CLI/widget/
  manipulator round trips, commit/cancel/revert, invalid-input immutability,
  plugin reload, multiple views, and database mutation invalidation.

### Drawing and LoD

- Modes 0--5 on appropriate moss/rook models, with LoD auto and off.
- Generic Twin shaded/wire cold/warm and LoD auto/off; compare `ae 90 0` and
  oblique views to the main baseline for skin seams, engine, tail, underside,
  lighting, and boxes.
- Lucy cold/warm zoom in/out and rotation; check spatial page coverage,
  crack-free wings, retained history, in-motion refinement, uniform zoom-out
  quality, and resident-memory recovery.
- Hubble shaded/wire selection, resize, erase/redraw, and importance floors.
- NIST BREP shaded/wire, LoD auto/off, adaptive tessellation growth, and
  zoom-out reclamation.
- Multi-Lucy/xpush turnover; bring old and new instances into view while
  retaining shared assets and interaction responsiveness.
- 5k/50k/150k cold and certified-warm shaded/wire runs, including rotation,
  zoom, selection, exact subpath erase/redraw, and retained terminal frames.

### Discovery, performance, and visual significance

- Measure read-only discovery on cold local storage, warm page cache, and
  slower storage.  Record elapsed time, worker concurrency, I/O behavior,
  peak bytes, and tree/GED parity.
- For 50k and a real model, collect perf.  Separate discovery, compact
  planning, worker/cache, upload/preparation, and raster work from diagnostic
  JSON/image compression.
- Capture APNG for any visual cycle; compare terminal and representative active
  frames to the main baseline where available.
- Record time to overview, leaf coverage, first useful mesh, view ready, stable
  return, p50/p95/max input latency, completed-frame time/FPS, resident/peak
  memory, cache growth, and quality-floor debt.
- Evaluate visual-importance results using wheels, blades, tails, hulls, and
  fasteners.  Synthetic terminal coverage alone is not evidence of adequate
  visual quality.

## Evidence retention

Keep one shared copy of reusable large inputs and canonical warm caches.  Keep
the event script, final report, representative checkpoint images, and perf/APNG
only when they explain a result.  Remove redundant transient screenshots,
trace logs, and duplicate generated models after recording the needed evidence.
